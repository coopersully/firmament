# When first starting out, it can be hard to gain experience
# in such a small area, making it difficult to expand the firmament.
# Because of this, you can enable a "handicap" item to be given to
# players upon their first time joining the server. If enabled, each
# player will be given a single random item from the list below.

  # What items should the player receive upon joining?
  # All the below items are guaranteed.

    - STONE_SWORD
    - STONE_PICKAXE
    - EXPERIENCE_BOTTLE
  # What items should the player be able to receive upon joining?
  # They will receive one (1) of the possible items.

  # Should the server announce when the firmament changes in size?

  # Should the server display a boss-bar HUD on the top center of the screen?
  # This is similar to announcements, but is less invasive and sleeker.

# Sacrificing allows players to permanently sacrifice experience
# levels to the server in order to gain permanent space in the
# firmament; permanent blocks are purchased at a rate of 1 Level : 1 Block.
sacrifice:
  # Should sacrifices be allowed?
  enabled: true
  # What percentage of the world border should the minimum sacrifice require?
  # "percentage: 10" means that sacrifices must be 10% of the world border's current size.
  # So if the border was 200 blocks wide, sacrifices must be >= 20 experience levels.
